### IntelliJ IDEA tips

- Enter project folder and execute `play idea`. Then you can open project from IDEA.
- From IDEA (with Play plugin installed) you can create a Play run configuration.
- Unmark as source root `target/scala-2.10/sc_managed/main` if you see errors in `Application` class.

### Markdown tips

To edit Markdown files you can use [Showdown] or [Markable].
Showdown is faster and Markable is nicer and lets you save your pages.
